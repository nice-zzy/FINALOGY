[0:00 - 0:15] OPENING
----------------------
FinAlogy: A Vision-Language System for Candlestick Pattern Analogy and 
Automated Reporting.
An interactive system that shifts financial analysis from rigid pattern 
classification to data-driven visual analogy, powered by retrieval-augmented 
report generation.

---

[0:15 - 0:45] PROBLEM & MOTIVATION
----------------------------------
Traditional financial analysis relies on a fixed taxonomy of candlestick 
patterns—such as "Hammer" or "Engulfing."

Yet these predefined rules fail to cover the vast diversity of real-world 
candlestick sequences, limiting their practical utility.

Analysts need to ask: "When did the market show a similar shape before? 
What happened next?"—but rigid classification cannot answer this.

FinAlogy addresses this gap by shifting the paradigm from classification 
to data-driven visual analogy.

---

[0:45 - 1:00] SOLUTION OVERVIEW
-------------------------------
FinAlogy consists of three main components: a specialized encoder pre-trained 
on large-scale historical candlestick data for visual analogy; a retrieval 
module that identifies analogous market segments for any query image; and a 
RAG pipeline where an LLM synthesizes historical evidence into professional, 
interpretable reports.

---

[1:00 - 1:15] MODULE 1 - Similar-Pair Construction
--------------------------------------------------
First, we extract 52-dimensional features from OHLCV data and use cosine 
similarity to find similar windows across 30 Dow stocks. We then render each 
window as a 224-by-224 candlestick image for visual encoder training.

---

[1:15 - 1:30] MODULE 2 - Self-Supervised Encoder
------------------------------------------------
Second, we train a Vision Transformer encoder with VICReg—a self-supervised 
method that requires no negative samples. Pre-trained on large-scale 
historical data, this encoder learns to identify visually and semantically 
analogous market segments for any query candlestick image.

---

[1:30 - 1:50] MODULE 3 - RAG Pipeline & LLM Report Generation
-------------------------------------------------------------
Third, the retrieved analogues are integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented 
Generation pipeline. A Large Language Model synthesizes historical evidence 
and market outcomes into professional, interpretable financial reports—grounded 
in empirical precedents rather than fixed taxonomies.

---

[1:50 - 2:20] INTERACTIVE PLAYGROUND DEMO
-----------------------------------------
Here is a live demo of our Interactive Playground. We upload a candlestick 
chart—for example, a recent window from Apple stock. The system encodes it, 
searches over tens of thousands of historical windows, and returns visually 
and semantically analogous market segments.

Each result shows the ticker, date range, and similarity score. The LLM then 
synthesizes these retrieved precedents into a professional report—pattern 
analogy, historical outcomes, key levels, and risk considerations. All in 
real time.

[2:20 - 2:30] CLOSING
---------------------
FinAlogy is publicly available at github.com/nice-zzy/Kline, along with 
open-source code and a demonstration video. Thank you for watching. We look 
forward to your feedback at ACL 2026.
